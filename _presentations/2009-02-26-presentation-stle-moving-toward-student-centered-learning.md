abstract: "Youâ€™ve heard the buzz words: knowledge construction, collaborative group work, Web 2.0. But what does this look like in a real university course? How do instructors move towards student-centered learning with collaborative technologies? Presenters will share examples of courses that successfully use collaborative technologies to benefit student learning. Participants will learn how several tools are currently being used on-campus to facilitate collaborative learning and become more informed about pedagogical considerations for increasing student interaction through the use of collaborative technologies."
