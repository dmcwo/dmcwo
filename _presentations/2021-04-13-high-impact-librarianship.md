abstract: "This panel will feature librarians  who have collaborated with faculty and other campus partners to develop innovative, high-impact information literacy programs on a variety of campuses, large and small. 
Further, the librarians on this panel have navigated recent covid-19-necessitated changes that demanded adaptation to develop new ways to keep students focused and interested. It is the ‘I’ of HIP, the impact, that is the operative word in each of these examples.  These librarians will discuss the challenges and successes of transitioning traditional classes and programs online, offering attendees concrete, multi-modal examples of high-impact student engagement in a changing environment."
