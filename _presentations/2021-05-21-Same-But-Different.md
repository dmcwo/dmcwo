abstract: "In this talk we share the values, personal and shared, that guided our early pandemic response efforts, discussing the essential importance of centering student voices and creating anti-hierarchy and anti-perfectionist frameworks. We consider this work through the lens of the 'Showing Up for Racial Justice' toolkit, and draw practical take-aways to help participants foster antidotes to white supremacy culture in their own organizations."
