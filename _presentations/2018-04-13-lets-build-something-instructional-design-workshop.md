abstract: "You already know what learning outcomes are. You’ve made more than enough LibGuides. Now you’re ready to do something different. Bring a learning outcome that you’d like to develop into a learning object, and spend the preconference workshop applying learner-centered and design-thinking frameworks to turn ideas into actionable prototypes ready for user feedback. This workshop will help you think creatively about pathways to a publishable prototype, paying special attention to varying resources and expertise. The guiding principles behind this workshop are to build imperfect solutions quickly and on purpose, to target highly specific outcomes, and to start with small and manageable projects. This iterative process begins with identifying learner challenges, then moves to imagining and creating focused interventions and partnering with learners for feedback and improvement. We aim to break down perceived barriers and build confidence and competence in designing a learning object, regardless of technical expertise or educational background."
