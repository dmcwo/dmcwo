place: Los Angeles, CA
abstract: "Your options for hybrid and online approaches to research skills and information literacy instruction just keep growing! In addition to the suite of online modules created by UCLA Library staff https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/, there are numerous videos, tutorials, and other resources available to you as well. In this interactive session, we will discuss how pre- and post-assignments can help you free up time in your library instruction sessions for more active learning and critical inquiry. We will also take a look at ways in which integration of research skills support into LibGuides and CCLE can help you extend access to information literacy skill development to more learners and researchers at UCLA. And then weâ€™ll wrap things up with an open discussion of the future of hybrid and online approaches to research skills instruction and share ideas on future collaborations and next steps. "
