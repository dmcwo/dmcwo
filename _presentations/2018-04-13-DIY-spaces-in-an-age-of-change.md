abstract: "What happens when key campus partners are running very successful undergraduate education programs but don’t have adequate space for them? UCLA’s Center for Education Innovation and Learning in the Sciences (CEILS) and Undergraduate Research Center (URC)-Sciences were running collaborative and active learning programs to promote student success and decrease achievement gaps in STEM courses; however, both programs had significant space needs. In this poster, presenters will share an innovative pilot program where the Science Libraries rapidly repurposed an existing library space with limited budget to integrate peer-led drop-in academic support, TA workshops, and collaborative study space. The project has led to a large increase in space usage, more campus visibility for the library, and new opportunities for library engagement with students, staff, and faculty. The project includes collection of data on best practices in space design for one-on-one and small group collaborative learning in the sciences and will inform future library re-design efforts. The presenters will share tips on advocating for and creating DIY, low budget, and experimental use of library space in collaboration with campus partners."
