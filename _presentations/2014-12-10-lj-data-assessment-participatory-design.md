abstract: "The Claremont Colleges Library has developed a range of approaches to holistically evaluating information literacy (IL) learning and perceptions among students and faculty, as well as strategically identifying the best points of IL intervention across the complex curriculum of the seven Claremont Colleges. Char Booth and Sarah Lower consider approaches to applying teaching and learning-related data to improve pedagogy, enhance program effectiveness, and compellingly demonstrate the impact of librarian collaboration on student performance. UCLA Libraryâ€™s Inquiry Labs leveraged library public service statistics, data from campus partners, and participatory design to develop new spaces and services. Doug Worsham suggests strategies and provide tips to encourage a culture of engagement and continual improvement."
