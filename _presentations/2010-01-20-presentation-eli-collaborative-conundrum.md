abstract: "Students and instructors have access to a broad range of collaborative technologies for group projects, but successful group work is not just about the technology. In this session, the presenters will use research data and personal experience collected from a yearlong program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on “Technology-Enhanced Collaborative Group Work” to highlight the principles of successful group work. Attendees will participate in a discussion on preparing instructors and students for collaboration, designing appropriate group assignments, assessing the process and product of group work, and choosing the *right* technology for collaboration."
