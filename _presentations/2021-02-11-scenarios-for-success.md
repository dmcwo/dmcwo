This poster illustrates possible project scenarios and features a cast of potential collaborators to show attendees how to connect with librarians to develop hands-on learning experiences. Through discovery, reflection, and application, librarians demonstrate the value of integrating information literacy skills to enrich students’ engagement in their courses."
