title: "Common threads of healthy discontent about assessment"
date: 2017-05-31
presenters: Doug Worsham
meetingname: "LAUC Conference Round-up"
meetingurl: 
place: Los Angeles, CA
abstract: "In libraries, we're in the early stages of a very important effort to re-think assessment. ACRL's Value report, the impressive and growing number of Assessment in Action projects, and an increased interest in connections between libraries and SOTL all offer positive steps forward and practical approaches to assessment and improved communication of the essential value of library staff, services, and collections. In general, these are very good things. At the same time, however, we're seeing more and more unrest and discomfort among many library staff about how assessment is interpreted, discussed, and implemented in libraries. It may already be time to re-think our approach to assessment (again). This talk explores threads of discontent about assessment gathered at three recent conferences, and tries to constructively reframe our conversation from discussing a culture of assessment to fostering a culture of learning."
