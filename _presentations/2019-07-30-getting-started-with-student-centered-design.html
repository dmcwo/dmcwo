abstract: "Teaching is wonderful, but co-creating with students is even better. Join us to learn how to launch your own student-centered design team! In this fun, hands-on workshop we will share how UCLA's WI+RE (Writing Instruction + Research Education) team of graduate and undergraduate student designers creates award winning interactive media. We will take a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of WI+RE's "Wheel of Sources," a recent online tutorial focused on helping learners differentiate primary and secondary sources. And most importantly, we will share WI+RE's open toolkits for learner-led design and help you envision launching a design team at your own institution!"
