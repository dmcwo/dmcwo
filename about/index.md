## Hi there! I'm [Doug Worsham](http://twitter.com/dmcwo)

This site is an experimental online notebook for jotting down ideas, tinkering with web design, and sharing notes and handouts from [conference presentations]({{site.url}}/presentations). I try to write here about learning, libraries, knowledge building communities, instructional design, the creative process, and the diverse practices of researchers and writers.
