<p>So true!</p>

<p>The conversation got started with:</p>

<h3 id="in-what-ways-does-the-philosophy-behind-critical-librarianshipcritlib-complement-or-run-counter-to-the-philosophy-behind-fye-liw16">In what ways does the philosophy behind critical librarianship/#critlib complement, or run counter to, the philosophy behind FYE? #liw16</h3>

<p>An interesting start, as it quickly made me realize I hadn’t taken a critical look at FYE, or its history. The discussion here walked through the somewhat complicated origin story for FYE programs, and then raised a number of interesting questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are some FYE programs overly focused on homogeneity?</li>
  <li>How do we balance the need for orientation and foundational skills with calls for more individualized and tailored research processes and instructional practices?</li>
  <li>Is there inherent complexity in creating systems and structures from a critical framework (that often involves critique of systems and structures)?</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/kevinseeber">@kevinseeber</a> provided a potential antidote to these concerns, or at least the beginnings of one, by offering:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like to think about small fye - the experiences of students in their first year on campus. What are their existing foundational experiences?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This led an audience member to reflect that there are different types of FYE programs – some built around academic themes (e.g., common books), some revolving around a pre-planned sequence of experiences, and others offering an “open-menu” approach to FYE where there are many options and pathways.</p>

<p>As the conversation turned to questioning how can we teach the workings of an academic system while also being engaged in its critique, another audience member offered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can help students learn an academic language of critique. If they don’t have that language, they can’t critique that language.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-barriers-eg-seeing-students-as-entering-with-a-deficit-exist-to-bringing-critlib-into-the-fye-curriculum">What barriers (e.g., seeing students as entering with a deficit) exist to bringing #critlib into the FYE curriculum?</h3>

<p>The concept of “deficit” seems to be pervasive on campuses, and it is clear we need a new way of thinking about this.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/liw16?src=hash">#liw16</a> Comment: It's not a deficit to be able to do your homework, work two part-time jobs, and take care of your mom. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/critlib?src=hash">#critlib</a></p>— Lisa Hubbell (<a href="https://twitter.com/lisahubbell" class="user-mention">@lisahubbell</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/lisahubbell/status/741029247314100224">June 9, 2016</a>

<p>It is surprising how often academic professionals mention students’ perceived “lack of readiness” for university level work. Recently I have wondered if these conversations need to be reframed in terms of <em>university’s</em> lack of readiness - both pedagogically and in terms of campus climate - for its own students?</p>

<h3 id="how-can-we-introduce-critlib-into-the-fye-curriculum-at-a-level-that-transcends-patchwork-attempts-by-individuals">How can we introduce #critlib into the FYE curriculum at a level that transcends patchwork attempts by individuals?</h3>

<p>Inevitably, we veered here into tricky territory when someone wondered where the one-shot came from ….?</p>

<p>While the implication may have been that perhaps the one-shot was externally imposed, it seems that, at least at some universities, the one-shot was the thing that previous cohorts of librarians were advocating for …. At our organization I have heard that much of the political work behind the standards involved a tremendous advocacy effort to highlight the importance of IL, and that this advocacy effort led to wider adoption of the one-shot, both by instructors and librarians.</p>

<p>I began to wonder: should we view the one-shot as a useful step toward greater connections between the library and the curriculum, or as a mis-step?</p>

<p>I tend to want to view things like this developmentally, but perhaps I’ll get a chance to think and write more on that later….</p>

<h3 id="what-approaches-to-bringing-critlib-into-the-fye-curriculum-havehave-not-worked-on-your-campus-liw16">What approaches to bringing #critlib into the FYE curriculum have/have not worked on your campus? #liw16</h3>

<p>On no! The working / not working assessment dichotomy appears again!</p>

<p>The ensuing conversation on assessment prompted the <em>top tweet</em> of the conference:</p>

<p>So true!</p>

<p>At other points during this session the panelists and the audience questioned whether the phrase “evidence-based practice” potentially privileges quantitative methodology and ultimately neoliberal/corporate educational practice.</p>

<p>These conversations were a part of what I found to be a healthy discontent at LIW with our current professional dialogs on assessment. Questioning asssessment was a strong theme throughout, and the conference helped me begin to give voice to some of the things I have found unsettling about how we often talk about (and implement) assessment.</p>

<p>I’m hoping in my own personal practice as well as in wider conversations about library services, to discuss assessment more developmentally. Rather than trying to classify something in the <em>worked</em> or <em>didn’t work</em> boxes, I’m wondering if we might ask questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How did this program benefit learners and researchers?</li>
  <li>What was the impact both academically and in terms of the <em>whole learner</em>? How do we know?</li>
  <li>Did we give opportunities for learners and researchers to not only provide feedback, but co-create our next steps? What did we learn and how can we improve? What’s next (for everyone involved)? Did we expand the adjacent possible?</li>
</ul>

<p>Well after the alotted time for the session had passed, the panelists and quite a few of us in the audience stuck around for more discussion. My notes on the session rounded out with this very student- and learning- centered call to remember to honor the knowledge in the room:</p>
