abstract: "The cascade of events following the global outbreak of COVID-19 produced exceptional examples of camaraderie, collaboration, and resourcefulness. In this article, we share two ways UCLA Library public services staff came together to rapidly re-envision learner-centered library services and support in response to the COVID-19 campus shutdown. In both cases, library staff adapted existing services (e.g., workshop delivery and tutorial design) to embrace remote technologies and scale to meet the needs of a greater number of learners."
