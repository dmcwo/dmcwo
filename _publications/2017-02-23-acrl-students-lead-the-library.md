abstract: |
    Academic librarians are driven by the belief that student scholars are at the heart of the library. Our collections, programs, and services become meaningful when students use and learn from them. We build our websites and other digital services, our buildings, marketing and communication strategies, and content to meet their needs. The library exists, at least in large part, for the studentsâ€”and student employment, leadership, and input into the library can increase engagement and outreach and improve both the library and the students it employs.
